```{r setup}
library(tidyverse)
```

Focus on readr package. 

## Read in some data

absolute path vs. relative paths (always use relative paths)
  * absolute paths are easier, relative path requires you to know the starting point
  * R give you a starting point - your file folder 
  * relative paths is table, anybody downloarding the file can use it

Read in the litters datasets.

```{r}
litters_df = read_csv("./data/FAS_litters.csv")
litters_df = janitor::clean_names(litters_df) 
```

## Take a look at the data
